# Scale matters: attribution meets the spectral domain to explain model brittleness to image corruptions

## Overview 

## Main results

## Usage

If you want to use the source code of the Spectral attribution methods or replicate our results, we recommend you create a virtual environment. This can be done as follows:

```python
conda env create -file spectral_attribution.yml
conda activate spectral_attribution
```

### Using the spectral attribution methods (WCAM and Fourier-CAM)

The source code of the spectral attribution method is located in the folder `spectral_sobol`. This source code is based on Fel et. al.'s (Sobol attribution method)[https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/da94cbeff56cfda50785df477941308b-Abstract.html] (NeurIPS 2021). You can access a demo of this attribution method in the notebook `example.ipynb`.

### Replication of our results

The folders `scripts` and `notebooks` contain the scripts and notebook used to generate the results presented in the paper. In addition to these scripts and notebooks, you will need to download the ImageNet validation set (accessible (here)[https://www.image-net.org/download.php]) and the supplementary material provided in our (Zenodo repository)[].
